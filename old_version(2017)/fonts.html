    <p>With every bite of food, <span>we put in our mouth hundreds</span> of such biologically active compounds. These molecules interact with each other the moment we swallow them, and as the food gets digested and metabolised, also react with other biomolecules in our body and with trillions of bacteria in our guts.
    </p>

    <p>
    Many of the compounds found in plant-based foods belong to the same chemical classes as drugs. It is not surprising therefore that almost half of small molecules approved for anti-cancer therapies are derived from natural products. These drugs are generally more tolerated and less toxic to healthy cells.
